# ExoplanetPlot
A plotting tool for the current exoplanet population taken from exoplanets.eu

The tool produces a plot for the current exoplanet population sorted by detection method (RV, Transit, Microlesning, and Direct Imaging). 
The limits for transit detection have been hand drawn. 
The limits for radial velocity have been calculated using a 1 m/s semi-amplitude limit (assuming a circular, face on orbit). 
Six solar system planets (Earth, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have been added for comparison.
